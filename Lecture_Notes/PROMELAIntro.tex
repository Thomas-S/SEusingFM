\begin{itemize}
\item put variable declarations at start
\item non-initialized arithmetic variables are set to 0
\item the values $\mathbb B = \{\texttt{true,false}\}$ are syntactic sugar for the bit values 1 and 0
\item there is at most one \texttt{mtype} \emph{(message type)} per program
\item first statement after ``\texttt{::}'' is considered as the \emph{guard}
\item if more than one guard is true, then one is randomly chosen
\item use ``\texttt{->}'' after command that starts with ``\texttt{::}'', not ``\texttt{;}''
\item \emph{blocking} occurs if no guard is true
\item feel free to declare constants with ``\texttt{\#define C val}''
\item there are two possibilities to express a for-loop
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``\texttt{for (i : 1 .. 6)}'' iterates over \texttt{i} from 1 to 6
\item ``\texttt{for (i in a)}'' iterates over all indices \texttt{i} of array \texttt{a}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
